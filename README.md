# Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Projects

This repository documents my hands-on journey through the analog and digital IC design flow using the **Cadence Virtuoso** suite. Each project follows the complete cycle from schematic design and simulation to physical layout, DRC/LVS verification, and post-layout performance analysis.

## Projects

| Circuit Block | Description | Key Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Common-Source Amplifier**](./CS_Amplifier) | Designed and characterized a basic gain stage. | Gain, Bandwidth |
| [**CMOS Inverter**](./Inverter) | Designed and analyzed the fundamental digital building block. | VTC, Propagation Delay |
| [**2-Input NOR Gate**](./NOR_Gate) | Transistor-level design of a basic logic gate. | Truth Table, Delay |
